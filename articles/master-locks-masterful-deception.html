        Master Lock Company just celebrated their 100th anniversary, but, as with nearly all super centenial companies, Master Lock company has its fair share of skeletons in the closet.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        To any unsuspecting Home Depot or Lowe's customer in the United States, the padlock and non-door lock section is dominated by a respectable brand all bearing the acceptable engraving of Master.
        However, any lock-savvy buyer, locksmith, lockpicker, or security professional would likely let out a dissapointed sigh, thinking to themselves, "I could pick you, rake you, break you, and look at you, and you'd all open faster than if I used the key."
      </p>

      <br>
      <p>
        What is it about these locks that makes experts sigh, and customers nod in satisfaction? In the following article, we'll be drawing upon some of the main complaints by one of the internet's favorite members of the locksport community:
        the LockPickingLawyer. His insight comes from years of picking, breaking, scratching, filing, and giving Master Lock Company chance after chance after chance to make a product that would earn a thumbs up from a anybody who knows their way around the inside of a lock.
      </p>
      <br>

     <h2><u>Easily Pickable Cores</u></h2>
     <p>
       In order to appreciate what you're about to read, you'll need to know a little bit about how locks work. The <em>core</em> of a lock is the part that interacts with the key. The kind of core in most Master Locks are called <em>pin tumbler</em> cores.
       What that means, is in your lock there is a stack of 2 pins. If you look in a keyhole, you can see the bottom pins sitting there. For simplicity's sake, we'll call these top pins and bottom pins. If you try to turn the lock without the key, or with the wrong key,
       the core will bump against either the top or the bottom pins, and won't turn. In order to move the pins out of the way, you'll need to use the right key, or find some way to rise each pin to the point where the two pins touch. Once the touch point in the pin stacks
       is aligned with the edge of the core, the core will turn.
     </p
     <br>
     <p>
       One of the big problems with Master Locks is that the way that they're made makes them really easy to pick, even for an amateur. They contain no special security pins, and are designated as the ideal beginner lock by the locksport community thanks to their reliable lack of security features.
     </p>

     <h2><u>Poor Design</u></h2>
     <p>
       Sometimes, designers and engineers make a mistake. Manufacturing goofs up. And then there's Master Lock, where products with mistakes are sold that way on purpose.
     </p>

     <p>
       Have a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5jzHw3lXCQ&t">this video</a> that shows a few of Master Locks more amusing blunders that they've refused to fix.
     </p>
     <br>

     <h2><u>Inaccurate Ratings</u></h2>

     <p>
      On the left side of Master Lock's packagaing, there is a scale of how secure Master Lock says the given product is. These ratings are much more geared towards physical toughness, and not security as a whole.
      As you can see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBM91Mw8EdY">here</a>, their rating system leaves much to be desired in terms of how difficult it is to keep your possessions safe. As a final nail in the coffin,
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxmmwWwW6TY">this</a> video shows one of the most secure locks the company produces, rated a 10, defeated in seconds.
    </p>
     <br>

     <h2><u>Conclusion</u></h2>

     <p>
      To be perfectly fair to Master Lock, most people don't take the time to learn the precise art of lock picking. (Why would you, when there are so many lovely rocks in the world to smash locks with, some criminals may reason.)
      While statistics do show most thefts are through lock destruction, and very few, if any, padlocks can stand up to a few minutes with the angle grinder, Master Lock is not doing anybody any favors by claiming that it's products
      are paragons of security when even totally inexperienced people can look up the easily exploitable weakness of their products on Lockopedia and disable several of their most popular and highly-rate products with tools wildely availble on the internet.

     <p>
      Here's to hoping that the company may make some positive changes in the next 100 years, and here's to all the smiles and laughter about their products that we'll share if they choose not to.

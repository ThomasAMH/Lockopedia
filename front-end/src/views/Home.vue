    <div class='content-box'>
      <p>You have the right to privacy, to safety, and to property. Locks are one of the most common means of providing these basic rights. Their are the guardians
      of our cargo, cars, houses, trailers, storage units, lockers, suitcases, and so much more.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Sadly, all too many people just don't know <strong>the truth</strong> about the security of the locks that protect their valuables and their homes.
         Since the beginning of locks, there have been people who have devised means, sometimes clever, sometimes destructive, to open locks without the key,
         giving them access to that which somebody would have protected. <strong>Some of the most common brands of locks out there can be easily defeated by average people,
         without any specialized tools or noteworthy violence.</strong>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>

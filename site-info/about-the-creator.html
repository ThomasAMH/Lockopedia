      <h1>About the Creator</h1>
         <p>Thomas A. Montoya (Tom) is a professional software engineer and web devleoper. In college, he got so bored one day doing his studies that he decided to kill some time on YouTube. After discovering some of the biggest names in locksport, (Bosnianbill, Lockpickinglawyer and LockNoob) he decided to pick up a set of cheap Chinese picks and start his lockpicking journey. Lockopedia was born as a creative project during one of Tom's first web programming class. He's been picking locks and and working on Lockopedia, his labor of love for all the world to enjoy, ever since.</p>
